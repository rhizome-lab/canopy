# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in this repository.

## Project

**Canopy:** A universal UI client for arbitrary data sources. Not just read-only - includes a control plane for mutating, triggering, and interacting with the systems producing the data.

### Data Sources

Static, filesystem, network fetched/streamed, video, audio, binary, JSON, SSE, JSONL, protobuf, msgpack, etc.

### Control Plane

Canopy is data-format agnostic, and so is its control plane. You can:
- View data from any source
- Trigger actions on the system producing the data
- Mutate state through the same protocol
- Monitor multiple systems in unified views

This makes Canopy the "Project Hub" for Rhizome - viewing Lotus world state, triggering Winnow extractions, monitoring Cambium pipelines, all through format-agnostic adapters.

## Core Rule

**Note things down immediately:**
- Bugs/issues → fix or add to TODO.md
- Design decisions → docs/ or code comments
- Future work → TODO.md
- Key insights → this file

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered → document before proceeding.

**Don't say these (edit first):** "Fair point", "Should have", "That should go in X" → edit the file BEFORE responding.

**Do the work properly.** When asked to analyze X, actually read X - don't synthesize from conversation. The cost of doing it right < redoing it.

**If citing CLAUDE.md after failing:** The file failed its purpose. Adjust it to actually prevent the failure.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Create special cases - design to avoid them
- Create legacy APIs - one API, update all callers
- Do half measures - migrate ALL callers when adding abstraction
- Ask permission when philosophy is clear - just do it
- Replace content when editing lists - extend, don't replace
- Cut corners with fallbacks - implement properly for each case
- Mark as done prematurely - note what remains
- Fear "over-modularization" - 100 lines is fine for a module
- Consider time constraints - we're NOT short on time; optimize for correctness

## Design Principles

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches. When user says "WTF is X" - ask: naming issue or design issue?

**Simplicity over cleverness.** Standard patterns over custom abstractions. Functions over classes until you need the class. Use ecosystem tooling over hand-rolling.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

**When stuck (2+ attempts):** Step back. Am I solving the right problem? Check docs/ before questioning design.
