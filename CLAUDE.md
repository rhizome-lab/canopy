# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in this repository.

## Project

**Dusklight:** A universal UI client for arbitrary data sources. Not just read-only - includes a control plane for mutating, triggering, and interacting with the systems producing the data.

### Data Sources

Static, filesystem, network fetched/streamed, video, audio, binary, JSON, SSE, JSONL, protobuf, msgpack, etc.

### Control Plane

Dusklight is data-format agnostic, and so is its control plane. You can:
- View data from any source
- Trigger actions on the system producing the data
- Mutate state through the same protocol
- Monitor multiple systems in unified views

This makes Dusklight the "Project Hub" for RHI - viewing world state, triggering extractions, monitoring pipelines, all through format-agnostic adapters.

## Core Rule

**Note things down immediately:**
- Bugs/issues → fix or add to TODO.md
- Design decisions → docs/ or code comments
- Future work → TODO.md
- Key insights → this file

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered → document before proceeding.

**Don't say these (edit first):** "Fair point", "Should have", "That should go in X" → edit the file BEFORE responding.

**Do the work properly.** When asked to analyze X, actually read X - don't synthesize from conversation. The cost of doing it right < redoing it.

**If citing CLAUDE.md after failing:** The file failed its purpose. Adjust it to actually prevent the failure.

## Behavioral Patterns

From ecosystem-wide session analysis:

- **Question scope early:** Before implementing, ask whether it belongs in this crate/module
- **Check consistency:** Look at how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
- **Implement fully:** No silent arbitrary caps, incomplete pagination, or unexposed trait methods
- **Name for purpose:** Avoid names that describe one consumer
- **Verify before stating:** Don't assert API behavior or codebase facts without checking

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Create special cases - design to avoid them
- Create legacy APIs - one API, update all callers
- Do half measures - migrate ALL callers when adding abstraction
- Ask permission when philosophy is clear - just do it
- Replace content when editing lists - extend, don't replace
- Cut corners with fallbacks - implement properly for each case
- Mark as done prematurely - note what remains
- Fear "over-modularization" - 100 lines is fine for a module
- Consider time constraints - we're NOT short on time; optimize for correctness
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment

## Design Principles

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches. When user says "WTF is X" - ask: naming issue or design issue?

**Simplicity over cleverness.** Standard patterns over custom abstractions. Functions over classes until you need the class. Use ecosystem tooling over hand-rolling.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

**When stuck (2+ attempts):** Step back. Am I solving the right problem? Check docs/ before questioning design.
